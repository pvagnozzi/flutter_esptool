> 🔌 A professional Flutter package for ESP8266/ESP32 serial bootloader operations:
> chip detection, flash write/erase/read flows, MAC queries, and protocol utilities.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 Chip detection via ROM register magic + MAC address read.
- 💾 Flash write/erase flows with optional compression and MD5 verification.
- 📦 Clean layered architecture (`application`, `domain`, `transport`, `infrastructure`, `models`).
- 🧪 Hardware-free tests with scripted/mocked transport.
- 🖥️ Professional multilingual demo app in `example/esptool_ui`.

---

## 🚀 Installation

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_esptool: ^0.1.3
```

---

## 🔧 Development Commands

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter test test\unit
flutter test test\integration
flutter test test\e2e
dart pub publish --dry-run
```

Cross-platform automation lives in [`scripts/`](scripts/README.md):

| Workflow | Windows | Linux | macOS | Report |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Setup dev machine | `scripts\\windows\\setup-dev.ps1` | `scripts/linux/setup-dev.sh` | `scripts/macos/setup-dev.zsh` | terminal summary |
| Run tests | `scripts\\windows\\run-tests.ps1` | `scripts/linux/run-tests.sh` | `scripts/macos/run-tests.zsh` | `reports/tests/<timestamp>/` |
| Build examples | `scripts\\windows\\build.ps1` | `scripts/linux/build.sh` | `scripts/macos/build.zsh` | `reports/builds/<timestamp>/` |

Single test file:

```bash
flutter test test/unit/transport/slip_codec_test.dart
```

Single test by name:

```bash
flutter test test/unit/transport/slip_codec_test.dart --plain-name "round-trips a payload through encode and decode"
```
